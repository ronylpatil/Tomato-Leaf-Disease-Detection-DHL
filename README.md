<b>Description : </b>
Here I have used fusion of best of both world's, Machine Learning & Deep Learning. Image classification using XGBOOST and Random Forest by extracting features using VGG16 Pre-trained Network. 
In this project I am using Machine Learning as well as Deep Learning.
               We can call it as Hybrid AI or Hybrid Learning. I call it "Deep Hybrid Learning",
               because here we are using fusion of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 
               
               Here in this project I am combining best of the both world's, one is traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning to create a solution that
               works amazing well specially when we have limited training dataset.
               If we have lot's of data then deep learning works well as compare to traditional machine learning. But in case of very limited data
               ten's of images other than thousands of images then traditional machine learning works great. Now here we will take best 
               of both worlds meaning from deep learning world instead of doing deep learning lets only take convolutional filters and 
               extract features using convolutional filters and then take that responce or features that go into random forest 
               for classification.
